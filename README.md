# Things this app doesn't do

1. Double-clicking a file wonâ€™t open it. Although this would be nice, this is not one of my goals at this time.
2. The User will be unable to create, delete or modify files. This will be a read-only app only to provide proof-of-concept abilities only.
3. The User will be unable to get information (properties) about a selected file.
